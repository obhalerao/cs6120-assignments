Summary
In this assignment @SanjitBasker and I implemented a dataflow analysis framework and instantiated it on two dataflow analyses. We continued to use C++ for the assignment. We implemented the formation of CFGs (which is an extension of the basic block forming algorithm we used in the last assignment) and then wrote a template class for the dataflow analysis. We had some trouble getting the main program to take advantage of our template class, but it can be instantiated through a simple interface in which one provides the meet and transfer functions (and also a utility function for making "top" values with which to initialize the analysis). The analysis can proceed in a forwards or backwards direction, but we realized only after implementing the solver that it may have been a cleaner design to make this a template parameter.

Testing
In order to validate our implementation, we implemented analyses for constant propogation and defined variables. We then visualized our results by generating graphs in DOT. This was a bit painful because we couldn't find any C++ libraries for graphs that give full control over the rendered labels. So we decided to generate the graphs ourselves, which we visualized in Edotor.

For fun, we also implemented a DFS-based traversal of the CFG and used this to solve the dataflow equations: when we discussed this topic in CS 4120, we learned that solving the strongly connected components of the graph in order will result in faster convergence than a naive worklist, since nodes are solved after their dependencies. In both implementations, we measured the number of times that a node was taken off the worklist and processed (this is equivalent to counting the invocations of the meet function). This was the measure of "performance" for our `brench` benchmark, with the correctness being a text report of the dataflow results. Our results are hopeful, but it seems that in some CFGs the naive worklist can outperform the DFS-based solver. We are happy to report that the results are the same regardless of the solver.
